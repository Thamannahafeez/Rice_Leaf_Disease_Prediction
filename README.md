# Rice-Leaf Disease Prediction
 
The file identifies the Disease affecting the rice crops by using Convolution neural network.

The target has three classes namely
* Bacterial Leaf Blight
* Brown Spot
* Leaf Smut

The images are preprocessed using the ImageDataGenerator from the Tensorflow library.

The neural network model is initialised with two hidden layers in addition to the input and output layers.
